# MineMacro

MineMacro is an OpenSource Minecraft Macro Software. It lets you control your character to automate semi-automatic farms or any other repetative task. It has a simple GUI and Macro Profiles are save- and loadable. 


## Installation

Unzip the .zip located in Releases. If you get an Anti-Virus alert after unzipping you have to allow the Installer on your PC. If you don't trust it, you will have to compile the python program yourself. If python is intalled this isn't hard. More to that later.
